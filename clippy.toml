# Clippy configuration for json2toon_rs

# Note: Deny/warn/allow are set via command-line or code attributes, not here.
# Run with: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Common configuration options
# Uncomment and adjust as needed:

# msrv = "1.70"  # Minimum Supported Rust Version
# cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30
# too-many-arguments-threshold = 7
# type-complexity-threshold = 250
# single-char-binding-names-threshold = 4
# too-many-lines-threshold = 100

# For pedantic lints that should be allowed:
# Use #[allow(clippy::lint_name)] in code instead
